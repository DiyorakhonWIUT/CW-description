            <p>PAPER MAGAZINE: Perhaps the most impressive nationalistic performance in Almaty came from another nation,
                 Uzbekistan, whose LALI Fashion House put prints from the brand's homeland on shapes inspired by global 1970s fashion.
                 "With my team in Uzbekistan, we do all the best to adopt traditional ethnic art and beauty of Central Asian heritage
                 into the modern, fashion, to make it trendy and commercial," says Lali Fazilova, designer/owner of LALI Fashion House.
                 "It's all about Central Asia. For the global fashion community, Central Asia is an undiscovered world."</p>
